  "content": "Ancient travellers and tradesmen referred to Kochi, variously alluding to it as Cocym, Cochym, Cochin, and Kochi.[36] The Cochin Jewish community called Cochin 'Kogin' (Hebrew: קוגין‎), which is seen in the seal of the synagogue owned by the community[37]. The origin of the name 'Kochi' is thought to be from the Malayalam word kochu azhi, meaning 'small lagoon'."
